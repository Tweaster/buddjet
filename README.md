## Pricing

Buddjet is not for profit and a version of the application will be available on a fremium model. Down the line, the pro version will also be free but for now, in order to stay afloat and to fund the development of new features, we offer a paid version with extended features at less than a price of a cup of coffee.

Along our journey, we aim to develop new amazing projects and we are working hard to keep delivering free applications where users are not forced to endure annoying advertisements in return.
